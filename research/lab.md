## Facility

- Please apply for an [USD High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster](https://www.usd.edu/technology/research/high-performance-computing) account (Lawrence instead of Legacy), asking to be added to the "liu_lab" group, and then follow the instruction at <http://rcg.usd.edu/docs> and <https://github.com/jintonic/lawrence>.
- If you need an account for the [ORNL][] [HPC][] cluster, *phylogin1.phy.ornl.gov*, please apply for an [XCAMS][] account first, forward your account information by email to [Brian Ofsthus](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/brian-e-ofsthus), the administrator, tell him how you will use the cluster to do your research and cc the email to [Jing Liu](/research/group). After confirming with COHERENT collaborators, Brian can give your access to phylogin1 using the same [XCAMS][] account and password. phylogin1 can be accessed through [SSH][] in a terminal or [ThinLinc][], which provides a fully functional desktop environment.
- The USD creative services can print posters with a limit of 42" in one dimension. The request can be submitted [here](https://apps.usd.edu/administrative/creative-services/posters/app/)
- The USD creative services can print business cards. The request can be submitted [here](https://apps.usd.edu/administrative/creative-services/business-cards/app/index.cfm)

## Equipment

### Radioactive sources
- [Atlantic Nuclear Corp.](https://www.atnuke.com/nuclear/sources.htm) provides some common disk and tube sources with exempt quantity of gamma radiation.
- [Table of Isotopes (ToI)](http://nucleardata.nuclear.lu.se/toi/index.asp) provides a web interface to search for radioactive decay data of all isotopes.
- [X-ray Data Booklet](https://xdb.lbl.gov) provides information about X-ray emissions from various elements.

### Material
- [American Elements](https://www.americanelements.com) provides all kinds of materials in various forms, such as powders, foils, etc.
- [Refractive index database](https://refractiveindex.info/) for common materials

### Electronics
- <https://easyeda.com/>: Online PCB design and ordering platform, cheap and quick (about two weeks, even though it's from China)

### Machining
- A CNC machine and a 3D printer are avaible in P122. Small things can be produced there
- <https://www.hubs.com>: online machining, instant quote, standard tolerances: 0.125 mm (0.005"), if made in China, the shipping may be as long as 1 month
- <https://get.xometry.com>: online machining, instant quote, standard tolerances: 0.125 mm (0.005"), if made in China, the shipping may be as long as 1 month
- <https://www.protolabs.com>: online machining, quote available in a few minutes, same standard tolerances, part size is rather limited (less than 12"), usually more expensive than the two above

### Cryostat

- thin CF flanges: <https://uhvstore.com/collections/slim-line-cf>
