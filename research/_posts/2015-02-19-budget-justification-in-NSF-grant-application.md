Give enough time for people in the office of research to fill the form of 
proposal budget for you. If you give them only one day, they will sum up 
everything and just put a big number there, which is hard to justify. You can 
also maintain your own list in the budget justification, this way, you are 
independent from the office of research. Collect quotations well in advance, 
they help a lot in budget justification.
