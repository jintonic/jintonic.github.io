I got an Email from the [Department of Marketing Communications & University 
Relations][mcur] telling me that

The official news release entitled [State Grants Advance Public University 
research][snews] can be found in the [South Dakota State News][sdsn]. There is 
also a press release entitled [3 USD Faculty Among South Dakota Regents 
Research Grants Recipients][news] from [USD][].

According to the official news release, 8 out of 30 proposals were funded this 
year. The funding rate is about 26%, which is pretty high. However, the funded 
projects are all from different disciplines, meaning that, on average, only one 
proposal would be funded for a specific discipline each year. I did a little 
bit of Google search and found that the PIs of the 8 funded projects are all 
assistant professors. I guess the reason is that senior faculties are competing 
federal funds and kindly leave this pie to new comers.

Here is a short summary of the project I proposed to do:

**The principal investigator (PI) proposes to develop a segmented p-type 
point-contact high-purity germanium (Ge) detector to combine two of the most 
advanced Ge detector technologies, surface segmentation and point contact.  The 
former provides rich information for background identification; the latter 
offers low energy threshold and excellent pulse shape discrimination power. The 
difficulty lies on the fact that the lithium-diffused outer surface of a p-type 
point-contact detector is too thick to segment. This problem can be solved by 
replacing the lithium-diffused surface with a surface sputtered with amorphous 
Ge, the thickness of which is only ~0.1 microns. The crystal for the proposed 
detector can be provided by the Ge crystal growth facility at the University of 
South Dakota (USD); the surface evaporation technique can be learned from the 
Lawrence-Berkeley National Laboratory; the segmentation scheme can be 
determined by a sophisticated Ge detector simulation package developed by the 
PI and his coworkers. Such a detector may become an attractive solution for 
next-generation dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, 
well in line with the interests of both SURF and NSF. It is also a potential 
commercial product for radiation detection in industry or military, because of 
its sensitivity to low energy radiation and interaction positions. The proposed 
research activities will add Ge detector fabrication capacity on top of the 
already existing Ge crystal growth infrastructure at USD, and will produce 
valuable preliminary results to secure various external funds.**

One can also find at the beginning of this post a short video explaining this
idea in more detail.

To the general public, my project may be summarized as: **I propose to develop 
a new type of germanium detector to detect dark matter particles and to study 
neutrino properties in underground laboratories. It combines two major 
germanium detector technologies and has the potential to become a commercial 
product for radiation detections in industry or military.**
