NSF allows one to submit grant proposals through http://grants.gov (new system) 
or http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov (good old system). One should ask his local 
Office of Research which one should be used. SSN is needed to register a new 
account in [Fastlane] if one wants to do it by himself. It is not always 
available for a foreigner who just arrives in US. A easy way to do it is to ask 
the Office of Research to do it for you. The requirement on SSN is bypassed 
this way. You will be given enough information to login afterward.
