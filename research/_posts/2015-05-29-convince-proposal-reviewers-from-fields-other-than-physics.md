Sometimes your grant proposal will be reviewed by people from fields other than
physics. What are they looking for in your proposal? How can you convince them
with languages that they understand? I won the [Competitive Research Grant
(CRG)][CRG] provided by the [South Dakota Board of Regents][sdbor] recently.
Feedbacks from the reviewers gave me some hints to address those questions.

According to the review criteria listed in the grant solicitation, the proposed
work should be able to

- establish the foundation for successful awards from external funding in the
  future
- align with the research agenda for potential funding agencies
- demonstrate the potential for producing significant research capacity or
  technology transfer and commercialization potential for the institution/state
- present effective and attainable strategies for meeting clearly identified
  objectives
- go forward to a potential external funding source with only minor revisions

Good feedbacks:

> The PI has good training for the effort

> The illustrations in Fig. x,y,z assisted in providing an understanding of the
> methods

> The proposal could benefit from some editing for external funding proposals

Bad feedbacks:

> The proposed work is derivative to that already established in the field. The
> PI needs to clearly define their technology and differentiate it from the
> approaches that presently exist

> The ownership of intellectual property  developed under this project is the
> subject of some ambiguity. The PI should clarify the relationship between
> [USD] and xxx National Lab.
