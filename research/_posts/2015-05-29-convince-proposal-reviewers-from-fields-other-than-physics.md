Sometimes your grant proposal will be reviewed by people from fields other than
physics. What are they looking for in your proposal? How can you convince them
with languages that they understand? I won the [Competitive Research 
Grant][CRG] provided by the [South Dakota Board of Regents][sdbor] recently.
Feedbacks from the reviewers gave me some hints to address those questions.

According to the review criteria listed in the grant solicitation, the proposed
work should be able to

1. establish the foundation for successful awards from external funding in the 
future
2. align with the research agenda for potential funding agencies
3. demonstrate the potential for producing significant research capacity or 
technology transfer and commercialization potential for the institution/state
4. present effective and attainable strategies for meeting clearly identified 
objectives
5. go forward to a potential external funding source with only minor revisions

Good feedbacks:

> The PI has good training for the effort

You'd better provide convincing evidence in your CV that you have enough 
experience to carry on the proposed project.

> The illustrations in Fig. x,y,z assisted in providing an understanding of the
> methods

Use figures, tables instead of long text to illustrate core concepts. This will 
help people outside of the field to understand them.

> The proposal could benefit from some editing for external funding proposals

I emphasized in my proposal that I aimed at external funding

Bad feedbacks:

> The proposed work is derivative to that already established in the field. The
> PI needs to clearly define their technology and differentiate it from the
> approaches that presently exist

I thought I clearly stated what I wanted to do. Apparently, it was not clear 
enough for people from other fields to catch the difference between what I 
proposed and presently existing approaches. I will explicitly state the 
difference next time.

> The ownership of intellectual property developed under this project is the
> subject of some ambiguity. The PI should clarify the relationship between
> [USD] and xxx National Lab.

I never thought about this when writing the proposal. But yes, if my project 
has some commercialization potential, I really need to clarify the relationship 
between me and my collaborators from other institutions.

> The following phrase is awkward:...

I should have asked some native English speakers to proof-read the proposal.
