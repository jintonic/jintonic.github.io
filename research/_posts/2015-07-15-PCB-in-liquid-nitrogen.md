![PCB in liquid nitrogen]({{site.exa}}/PCB-in-LN2.jpg)

In order to test some [PMT][]s at [liquid nitrogen][LN2] temperature (77 
Kelvin), my students are designing some [Printed Circuit Board (PCB)][PCB] to 
apply high voltage to the [PMT][]s. However, whether PCBs work at that low 
temperature is a question. To find it out, they dumped an old PCB to [liquid 
nitrogen][LN2] several times and checked all pins, lines and soldering points 
and did not find anything wrong. Indeed, this board works at 77 Kelvin!
