I just submitted two grant applications to NSF. The funding mechanism of NSF is 
quite different from that of [JSPS] according to my own experience.

The *Investigator-Initiated Research Projects*, or the NSF regular grant, is 
applied by researchers in all ranks. A new comer will have to compete with 
veterans.  While [Grant-in-Aid] from [JSPS] provides many categories targeted 
at applicants with different ranks and experience. People compete with their 
fellows in similar ranks.

Postdocs are not qualified to apply for the NSF regular grant, while they can 
apply for [Grant-in-Aid] from [JSPS].

Reviewers are definitely experts in the field for NSF grant applications. While 
the [Grant-in-Aid] proposal can be reviewed by people from similar fields.

The amount of fund is fixed in a certain [Grant-in-Aid] category and 30% of it 
is for administration use. One should ask for exactly the same amount in the 
proposal for research even though he knows that only 70% can be used for 
research. The average amount of a NSF PHYS regular grant is ~$100k/year. But 
one can ask more than that as long as it is justified.

Personnel is not included in [Grant-in-Aid] from [JSPS], while it is included 
in NSF regular grant. Actually, a large portion of the fund goes to personnel, 
leaving just small amount for equipment.
