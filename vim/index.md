Plug-in's
=========

vim-pathogen
------------
[vim-pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) allows to install any
plugin by just dropping it in ~/.vim/bundle.

vim-markdown
------------
Vim regards "*.md" as modula2 files by default. This behavior can be overwritten
by installing
[plasticboy/vim-markdown](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown).
Unfortunately, it does not recognize YAML front-matters.

[tpope/vim-markdown](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown) with
[tpope/vim-liquid](https://github.com/tpope/vim-liquid) solves the problem but
it does not provide folding.
