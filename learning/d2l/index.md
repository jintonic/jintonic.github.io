## "Written Response" VS "Short Answer" Question

A "Short Answer" question in a quiz demands a preset answer when setting the question up. The user's answer has to be exactly the same as the preset answer to be auto-graded as right. A quiz report will only show the preset answer instead of individual's answers.

A "Written Response" question in a quiz does not need a preset answer. It will not be auto-graded and all user responses will be listed in the quiz report.
