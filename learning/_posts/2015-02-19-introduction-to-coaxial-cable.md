### Structure

Structure of a coaxial cable, coax in short, from inside out: core wire, 
dielectric insulator, 1 or several layers of metallic boil, mesh or braid, 
outer sheath or jacket. The top figure shows the dimension of a typical coax.

One layer of braid can block 95% of external interference with an approximate 
shielding effectiveness of -55 dB. The left 5% can be blocked by adding extra 
layers of foil with an approximate shielding effectiveness of -90 dB.

### Commonly used coax

*RG*, Radio Guide coax. Old military standard. Commonly used ones:

- RG-59, RG-6, RG-11 from low end to high end uses, impedance: 75 Ohm, outer 
  diameter: 6.1, 6.86, 10.5 mm, respectively. Used with F connectors for TV
- RG-58, RG-142 from low end to high end uses, impedance: 50 Ohm, outer 
  diameter: 5, 4.95 mm, respectively
- RG-316/U, RG-174, impedance: 50 Ohm, outer diameter: 2.6 mm, single shield, 
  used with LEMO 00 connector

*LMR*, [nobody knows what it stands for][k3dav]. Made by [Times Microwave
Systems][times]. Low loss coax, 50 Ohm.

- LMR-100A, outer diameter: 2.79 mm, replace RG-316/RG-174
- LMR-195, outer diameter: 4.95 mm (0.195 inch), replace RG-58, RG-142

### Connectors

*LEMO* 00, Leon Mouttet connector. Miniature push-pull 50 Ohm coaxial 
connector. Replacement of BNC in high density design, front panel connectors 
for NIM & CAMAC modules. Diameter: ~ 5 mm.

*BNC*, Bayonet Neill Concelman connector. Diameter: 14.5 mm (Male), 11.1 mm 
(Female). Passband: 0-4 GHz. Impedance: 75 or 50 Ohm. The 75 Ohm types can 
sometimes be recognized by the reduced or absent dielectric in the mating ends. 

*SHV*, Safe High Voltage (>500V) connector. Up to 5 kV DC, 5 A. 20 kV version 
also available.

*MHV*, Miniature High Voltage (>500V) connector. Up to 5 kV DC, 3 A. Easily 
mistaken as BNC.

*MCX*, Micro CoaX connector. Diameter: 3.6 mm. Passband: 0-6 GHz. Impedance: 75 
or 50 Ohm. Gold plated. Snap-on interface.

*SMA*, Sub-Miniature version A. Diameter: 7.9 mm. Passband: 0-18 GHz.  
Impedance: 50 Ohm. Screw coupling.

*F connector*, for TV. Cheap because core wire of cable is used as pin of male 
connector. Diameter: 11 mm. Passband: 0-1 GHz, Impedance: 75 Ohm.

### Cutters

Normal cutters with flat blades cannot keep a round cross section of the cable 
after cutting. Special cutters have to be used for coax.

### strippers

It is sometimes called coax prep tool, stripping tool, etc. Some of them have 2 
blades, some have 3 blades. This feature is labeled as 3-blade, 3-level or 
3-step. The stripping distances of 3-blade ones are normally 4 mm of 
dielectric, 8 mm of braid. Normally, the cutting depth of the blade is 
adjustable with an Allen wrench. Some strippers can be used for cables with 
various outer diameters.  Some are designed just for cables with similar outer 
diameters. For example, [HT-312B] is a 3-blade stripper for cables with 
diameters about 5 mm.

### Coax connector crimper

It normally has a frame with exchangeable dies. A die may have hexagonal 
cavities with different diameters.
