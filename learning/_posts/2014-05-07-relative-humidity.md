At a certain temperature and pressure, a blob of gas can only hold a certain 
amount of water vapor inside. If the temperature drops or the pressure 
increases, the maximum water vapor that this blob of gas can hold also drops.  
The water vapor starts to condensate on some cold surface as dewdrops. The 
temperature, at which the water vapor starts to condensate, is called the dew 
point. It is an absolute measure of the humidity of the gas at certain 
pressure. The higher the humidity, the easier for the water vapor to condensate 
(One does not need to lower the temperature a lot to see some dewdrops), and 
the higher the dew point. The dew point is a function of pressure.

The relative humidity is the ratio of actual amount of water vapor to the 
maximal amount of water vapor that a blob of gas can hold at a certain 
temperature and pressure. It is usually expressed in percentage. It is a 
function of both temperature and pressure. This is because when the temperature 
changes, the maximal amount of water vapor that the blob of gas can hold also 
changes, i.e., the reference changes, this causes the change of the ratio, 
which is the relative humidity.

At the atmospheric pressure, the dew point can be calculated from the relative 
humidity and temperature:
