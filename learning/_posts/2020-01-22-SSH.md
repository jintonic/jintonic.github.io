[SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) is the standard method to log into a remote Linux server. There is an SSH server program running in the remote machine monitoring any connection request from other machines. You can use an SSH client command or an SSH GUI to connect to that server:

```sh
$ ssh yourUserName@linux.server.name.or.ip
```

This is a lot of typing. If you log into the server frequently, you can reduce typing by saving some information in an `ssh` configuration file. If you don't understand the syntax of the command above, please read [Linux 101]({% post_url learning/2016-08-30-Linux-101 %}) first.

### Configuration of SSH client

#### Command line configuration

```sh
$ cd # make sure that you are in your home directory
$ mkdir .ssh # make a hidden directory called .ssh
$ chmod 700 .ssh # make it only visible to yourself
$ cd .ssh
$ touch config # create an empty configuration file (only needed in MobaXterm)
$ open config # works in macOS and MobaXterm, use 'mimeopen config' in Linux
```

Please refer to [chmod in wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod) for detailed usage of `chmod`. Please read more about [text editors]({{baseurl}}/tags#text-editor), if you don't know how to edit the `config` file.

The following is what's inside of an example `config` file that specifies a short nickname, "l", for server, "linux.server.name.or.ip".

```sh
Host l
HostName linux.server.name.or.ip
User YourUserName
```

Now you can log into the Linux server by only typing

```sh
$ ssh l
```

#### GUI configurations

Two popular GUI SSH clients that work on Windows are

- [PuTTY]({% post_url learning/2016-08-29-connect-to-Linux-from-any-Windows-PC %})
- [MobaXterm]({% post_url learning/2015-05-14-coding-on-linux-server-from-windows-pc %})

The default communication port for `ssh` is 22. It is set from the server side. If there is no specific instruction from your server administrator on the port number, it is mostly the default 22, there is no need for you to change it.

### Copy files through SSH

#### Command-line method

```sh
$ scp localFile user@server:path/to/remote/copy #copy local file to remote machine
$ scp user@server:path/to/remote/file localCopy #copy remote file to local machine
$ scp user@server:/absolute/path/to/a/file localCopy #specify full path to a file
$ scp user@server:path/relative/to/your/home/directory/file localCopy
```

#### GUI programs

MobaXterm in Windows provides a nice side panel that shows files in the current folder in the terminal. One can drag files in and out of it for copying. Mac users may want to try <https://cyberduck.io/>, or <https://filezilla-project.org/>, or <https://osxfuse.github.io/>. Linux users can try [SSHFS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSHFS).

### Edit remote files

#### Command-line methods
If you are an [Emacs][] or [Vim][] user, both editors provide commands to directly edit remote files.

[Emacs]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20624024/what-is-the-best-way-to-open-remote-files-with-emacs-and-ssh
[Vim]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/202918/how-do-i-remotely-edit-files-via-ssh

#### GUI programs

Double click on a remote file shown in the MobaXterm side panel after you `ssh` into a remote machine, the file will be open in the `MobaTextEditor`. When you save your modification of the file, the updated version will be uploaded to the remote machine automatically. The same method works in [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) and [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).

### Login without password

#### The easy way
Normally, a GUI SSH client can save your password to the server so that you don't have to type it next time. This can also be achieved in the command line through a file called `~/.netrc`. You can save your connection information (including the password) in this file:

``` sh
$ touch ~/.netrc
$ chmod 600 ~/.netrc # hide it from others
$ open ~/.netrc # edit it, put the following into it:
machine remote.server.name.or.ip login username password sZ\#Je/j@3
```

#### The right way
Your password is saved as it is in `~/.netrc`. A better way is to use [SSH keys](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_keys). The basic idea is that you generate a pair of keys, one is private, one is public. You upload the public one to the server and keep the private one secretly in your `~/.ssh`. Next time, when you log into the server, if the two keys match, you will be logged in without typing in your password.

### GUI through SSH

We can edit remote files using local editors as we described in the [previous section](#edit-remote-files). We can also use remote editors to edit remote files. Many editors can work inside a terminal, others create their own GUI, which have to be displayed in a [X][] Window server.

Windows users can use [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/), [Xming](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/), or [Cygwin/X](https://x.cygwin.com/) to establish an [X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) Window server in your local PC. Mac users can use [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/).

Once your [X][] Window server is running, you can let your `ssh` connection to the remote machine to send remote GUI program windows to your local machine and get displayed on your local [X][] Window server:

```sh
$ ssh -X user@server # enable forwarding X connections through ssh
$ gedit remoteFile & # edit a remote file using a remote editor
```

To avoid typing `-X` every time, you can add the following line to your existing `~/.ssh/config`:

```
ForwardX11 yes
```

[X]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System

### VNC through SSH

There are two problems in using X-window. First, it is slow. Second, there is no free X-window server in iOS. We need [VNC][] to overcome these problems.

[VNC]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing

#### VNC server

You can establish an VNC server in your remote machine following the steps below:

First, you need create a password for your VNC session using the following command:

```sh
$ vncpasswd
```

The password will be saved automatically in `~/.vnc/passwd`.

Second, run


```sh
$ vncserver
```

to start an VNC session. The command may also create `config`, `xstartup`, a log file and a file containing the process id of the VNC session in `~/.vnc/`. The VNC server will create an X Window server at the remote machine with a unique [X DISPLAY](http://www.softpanorama.org/Xwindows/exporting_display.shtml#Exporting_display_on_the_client) number, which can be figured out by running

```sh
$ vncserver -list

TigerVNC server sessions:

X DISPLAY #     PROCESS ID
:2              10949
```

The ":2" (including ":") is the DISPLAY number. Your VNC session is running at port 5900 + the X DISPLAY number, *i.e.*, 5902 in this concrete example.

Last, you can kill this session by

```sh
$ vncserver -kill :2
```

The X DISPLAY number cannot be ignored.

You can put some commands in `~/.vnc/xstartup`, which will be run automatically when the VNC server starts. An example `xstartup` file would contain something like:

```sh
fluxbox # a window manager
xterm # a terminal running in X Window
```

#### VNC client

[RealVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) provides viewers for most operating systems. MobaXterm includes a VNC client as well:

![MobaXterm sessions](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/img/moba/features/feature-sessions.png)

These GUI programs provide intuitive interfaces to setup your VNC connection. If there is no space for you to specify the port, you can attach it to the end of the remote machine name:

``` sh
remote.machine.name.or.id:5902
```

The port number must match the port number of your VNC server session.

#### Local port forwarding

The following command will forward `server.ip.address:8000` to `localhost:80`:

~~~sh
ssh -L 80:127.0.0.1:8000 server.ip.address
~~~

This can also be specified in the ssh config file:

~~~
Host servername
HostName server.ip.address
User username
LocalForward 80 127.0.0.1:8000
~~~

The port forwarding function is also available under MobaXTerm's *tools* menu.
