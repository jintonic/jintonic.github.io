After [logging into a Linux machine using PuTTY from a Windows PC]({% post_url 
/learning/2016-08-29-connect-to-Linux-from-any-Windows-PC %}), you may want to 
make sure that you are indeed in the machine that you intend to log in, just as 
you get to a new place in the real world, you'd like to look around. You need 
the above commands to figure out the surroundings.

You may ask immediately "how am I suppose to remember the usage of so many 
commands?" The answer is "No, you don't need to remember, you *man* it":

``` shell
$ man ls
```

The command *man* shows the usage of a command in detail. Type <kbd>q</kbd> to 
quit when you are done.

You may also ask "What is this */* thingy there?". This is the sign to separate 
directories. The output of the command `pwd` may look like `/home/YouUserName`. 
That means you are in your home folder and your home folder is a subdirectory 
of the `/home` folder, which is in turn a subdirectory of the `/` folder, which 
is called the root directory.

You can go to a directory using the `cd` (change directory) command:

``` shell
$ cd / # go to the root directory
$ ls
$ cd # go back to your home directory
$ cd - # go back to previous directory
$ cd /home/YouU # try press the tab key to autocomplete the command
```

Now you can get around. How about create something here?

``` shell
$ mkdir bin doc # make two directories
$ ls # make sure you have created them
$ cd doc
$ touch test # create a file
$ ls -l test # check the time stamp of the file
```

You may notice the hidden files shown in your home directory using the `ls -a` 
command:

``` shell
$ ls -a
.   ..    .bashrc     .profile
```

They all start with a dot. One dot means the current directory, two dots means 
the parent directory. So you can use the following command to go up one 
directory:

``` shell
$ cd ..
```

You may see something like `.bashrc`. This is a `rc` file. You will meet many 
`rc` files in the future. They are files to save configurations of various 
programs. `.bashrc` is the configuration file for a program called `bash`. The 
full name of the program is [Bourne Again SHell][bash]. It is one of the many
