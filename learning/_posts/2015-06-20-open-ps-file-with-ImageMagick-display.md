![ps file shown in ImageMagick 
display]({{site.ina}}/ps-file-shown-in-ImageMagick-display.jpg)

It is quite often for an experimental physicist to create some postscript files 
(ended with .ps) on a Linux server for data analysis or writing up papers. For 
various reasons, administrators may not want to install ps file viewers on 
servers. I just discovered that the `display` command provided by 
**ImageMagick** can actually be used to open a ps file without any extra menu 
bar, tool bar or status bar, as shown in the top screen shot. Press 
<kbd>q</kbd> when the window is active will dismiss the window. Quite handy 
indeed.
