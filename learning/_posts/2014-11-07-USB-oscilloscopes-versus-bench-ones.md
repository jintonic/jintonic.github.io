The stand-alone bench oscilloscope in practice is better than cheap USB ones.  
The later normally has very poor front-end electronics, low sampling rate and 
narrow bandwidth. [Picotech] provides high-end USB oscilloscopes. Given the 
same price, USB ones provides higher precision, more memory, more functions and 
better data logging, but less bandwidth and sampling rate than bench 
oscilloscopes.
