![histogram of oil change frequency]({{site.exa}}/oil.png)

I bought a second handed car last year. The dealer showed me a long maintenance 
record from [CARFAX][] and claimed that the car was very well served. Well, by 
simply looking at all the oil change records I would have to agree with him. 
However, I made a simple spreadsheet and generated the histogram above and 
realized immediately that the car was nothing more than being regularly 
maintained.
