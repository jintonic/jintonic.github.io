The Rigol DS6104 oscilloscope I purchased with my start-up arrived today.  It 
has no touch screen, but the price is 1/3 of those from big companies. The CD 
attached contains the software and drivers to operate the oscilloscope through 
USB or LAN. The readme file tells you to download USB driver from NI first.  
But it is misleading. One just need to extract files from *\SOFTWARE\Ultra 
Sigma(PC)Installer.rar* using 7z, run *setup.exe* and all drivers from NI will 
be installed automatically.

### Some basic things about oscilloscope

Oscilloscopes nowadays are basically all Digital Storage Oscilloscopes or DSO 
in short. They have front-end electronics to deal with analog voltage input, 
analog-to-digital converter to digitize the input signal, and internal or 
external memory to store the digitized waveforms for later display and 
analysis.

The top 3 oscilloscope companies are Tektronix, Agilent and LeCroy. Recently, 
Rigol in China provides the cheapest low end oscilloscopes with high quality.
