Linux inherits the [Unix Philosophy][] that a program should do only one thing and do it well. A complicated job should be done with a combination of many small tools. You probably won't call logging in to a PC and opening a file from a file browser a complicated task. But it takes the following programs to complete the task in Linux:

1. a [display manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Display_manager) to show the login screen,
2. an [X-window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) server to handle the graphical display,
3. a [window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager) to arrange windows on your desktop, and
4. a [file browser](https://wike.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:File_managers) to navigate through the directory tree and open the target file.

There are normally multiple programs that are available for each of the above tasks. This is one of the reasons why Linux desktops do not have a universal look as Windows desktops do.
