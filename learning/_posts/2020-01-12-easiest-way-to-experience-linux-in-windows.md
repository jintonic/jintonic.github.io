There are many ways to experience Linux in a Windows PC. You can install
Cygwin, WSL, VirtualBox, etc. to have a Linux running within Windows. However,
all of them requires some knowledge about Linux to begin with. It is possible
for a newbie to start experiencing Linux in Windows without installing
anything. Here is how.

Download a portable
[MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html), run it
and then start a local terminal within it. Ta-da, you can now experience the
Linux command-line user interface in a program running in Windows. Zero
installation is needed. You can even put it into a USB stick and run it in any
Window PC with or without administrator privileges.
