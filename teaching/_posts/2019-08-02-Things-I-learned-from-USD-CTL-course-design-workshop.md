Eversy summer, [CTL][] at [USD][] provides a fellowship for faculty members to sit together in a week long workshop to learn from each other or a resource how to design a new course or redesign an old course. Here is a list of things that I learned from it.

# Learning how to learn

- study plans made by students
  - signed by students and instructor as contracts
  - include both students' and instructor's expectation
  - leave flexibilities to modify
  - give a test period
  - ways to avoid burn-out
  - personal strength and weakness or characters
  - things to learn and to test
  - ways to assess
- practice
  - identify things that students don't understand

# Caring
Instructor cares about students, students care about each other, both care about the subject under study.

- motivation speach
  - their role in the world, value their role
  - course facilitate self growth
- real world examples, case studies
  - it triggers emotion
- instructor and students share personal feelings
  - it comforts others

- discussion, group project
  - students need to understand that their goal is to grow themselves instead of showing the "best" of themselves to others
  - let students to form groups by themselves so that they feel comfortable to work with their teammates

# Assessment

- frequent quiz, homework and exams with immediate feedback
- [IF-AT](http://www.epsteineducation.com/home/about/)
- Rubrics need to be included in assignment description
- template or other guidance for assignment
- different types and levels of assignment and grading
  - grade not only result, but also effort (break big project into small tasks that can be graded)
- grade harder at the beginning to create a steady improvement to encourage students
- or grade harder toward the end since students should have learned over the course
- give students information about her progress more frequently
- grade is a quantitative feedback
- stress test in a review class (a simulated test)
- pre-test to gause the progress
- Tell students that failing in a class is a low stake failure compared to a real life failure

# Others

- feedback from students
  - after class survey to get instant feedback
  - muddiest point (ask students what they don't understand)
  - fun questions (color of the instructor's glasses)
  - tell students usage of the data collected
- syllabus
  - office hour policy (students must schedule meetings with instructor to do something together)
  - syllabus quiz to check if students read it
  - easter egg hidden in syllabus
- Boyer's model
