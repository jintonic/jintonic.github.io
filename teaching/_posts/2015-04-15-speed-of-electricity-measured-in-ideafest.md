![speed of electricity measured in IdeaFest]({{site.exa}}/speed-of-electricity-measured-in-ideafest.jpg)

[IdeaFest] is an annual event at [USD] celebrating student research, creative
scholarship and academic engagement. Most students in [phys-332] signed up for
the event. One of them gave an oral presentation about the measurement of speed
of light in air performed in the class. The other two demonstrated lively how
we measured the speed of electricity in cables with a function generator, two
[coaxial cables] and an oscilloscope.
