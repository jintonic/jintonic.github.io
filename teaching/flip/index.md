Basic
=====

According to [wikipedia][wp] and citations therein, the basic concepts of flip
teaching include:
- students go through raw material by themselves at home
  - raw material includes videos, text books and web pages, etc.
  - they do not need to be made by teachers themselves
  - lengths of videos are better to be within 3 to 6 minutes
  - raw material is specified by teachers, but can be extended by students
  - processing raw material alone is easier than solving problems alone
  - speed of processing is controlled by students themselves
  - no need to take notes
- students do "homework" in class
  - teachers help students to solve problems in class
  - students can help each other
  - interactions between students and teachers are maximized
- students must master each lesson before going to the next one
  - an immediate test has to be taken after each lesson
  - students have to continue taking tests until they pass 

There is no obvious evidence that this method improves the performance of
students. But they are clearly better motivated.

I may do the following when teach a new class:
- go through raw material by myself first
  - take notes, make videos
  - provide half baked material to students
- design problems for "homework" and tests
- guide students to solve problems with teaching assistant

It is not clear to me what to do exactly in class.
