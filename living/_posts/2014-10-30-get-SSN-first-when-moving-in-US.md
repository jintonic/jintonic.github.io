One can work as a postdoc in US with two types of visa: J-1 and H-1B. No matter
which type, she is required to apply for a Social Security Number, or [SSN] in
short, ten days after her entering US. [SSN] is used for the US government to
record her salary payment for tax purpose. It is also needed for many other
services, optionally or mandated, such as driving test, enrollment of health
benefits, etc. One can find a nearby agency on http://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/ to
apply for it. The ten-day period is needed for her entrying information being
updated in the government's system.
