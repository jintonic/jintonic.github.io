# Base on Neuroscience

The basal ganglia controls the execution of automatic behaviors without consuming much energy. The frontal cortex controls concious behaviors, which consumes a lot of energy. The former is very reliable when one losses will power due to various reasons. The latter is necessary for concious self development, but cannot be over used. The best way is to use the latter in small steps to train the former frequently so that we can rely on the former most of the time.
