I worked in Japan for 5 years right before I moved to US. I was amazed to see 
that cars older than 10 years with mileages above 100 kilo miles were commonly 
used in US. Japanese tend to get rid of this kind of cars. This is probably due 
to the following facts:

- Major cities are all connected by super express trains in Japan. Cars are 
  mainly used in urban area with a lot of starts and stops.
- There is almost no train connection between cities in US at all. Cars are 
  used for inter city or inter state travels a lot.

It is easier to buy a car in US than in Japan. One don't need to find a parking 
lot first.

One does not need to have a driver's license to buy a car, as long as he can 
find someone else who can drive the car back home legally.

If you want to take a written test to get a driver's license, check

reading the *Driver License Manual*.
