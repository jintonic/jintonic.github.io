![radon concentration vermillion south dakota basement]({{site.ina}}/radon-concentration-vermillion-basement.jpg)

"I don't make nukes in my basement, why should I care?", you may ask. Well, if
you've never thought about radiation protection at home, chances are that the
concentration of a type of natually existing radioactive gas,
[radon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon), in your basement is many times
higher than the [acceptable
level](http://www.radon.com/radon/radon_levels.html). The plot shown here is
the radon concentration in the basement of a random house in Vermillion, SD,
over several days. It is always higher than the [level set by
EPA](http://www.epa.gov/radon/zonemap.html). The owner never heard about radon
and did not take any action to reduce the concentration. If you are alike,
please consider following the [advice from EPA](http://www.epa.gov/radon/).
