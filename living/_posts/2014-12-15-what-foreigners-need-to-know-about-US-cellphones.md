### Plans

A set of service is called a plan. There are roughly three types of plans:

- contract. You sign a contract with a carrier, paying fixed amount of money
  monthly for 2 or 3 years. Normally one can get newest cellphone models for
  free. But the monthly payment is rather high.
- prepaid. There are two sub categories:
  - You pay fixed amount of money monthly.
  - pay-as-you-go. You pay certain amount of money and the cost of each call is
    subtracted from it each time you make a call. 
- postpaid. You pay what you spent at the end of a certain period. You need
  some credit to choose this plan.

Pay-as-you-go is the cheapest if you don't need the newest phones.
