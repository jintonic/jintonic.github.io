@media
=======
There is no need to provide several css files, for example, one for screen, one
for printing, etc. The same functionality is provided by the
[@media](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_mediatypes.asp) rule.

id and class
============

There should be only one element in a page identified with an *id*, many
elements can share the same *class*.

According to [this web page](http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/)

> If you have a URL like http://yourdomain.com#comments, the browser will
> attempt to locate the element with an ID of "comments" and will automatically
> scroll the page to show that element... This is an important reason right here
> why having ID's be absolutely unique is important. So your browser knows where
> to scroll!
