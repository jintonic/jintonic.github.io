Students demonstrate how to strip a coaxial cable and crimp male BNC connectors
on its ends in PHYS-332 - Experimental Modern Physics, 2015, spring. 

It took me a while to find a 3-blade coax stripper with adjustable blades and
proper distances between blades. I ended up buying [one from
TerraWave](http://www.terra-wave.com/shop/stripping-tool-3-blade-for-tws195-p-715.html),
which has all important parameters written on their web page. It is easy to
find similar ones on amazon. However, you probably need to dig out those
important parameters by asking questions on amazon. It took the student a while
to adjust the cutting depths of all three blade to the dimensions of
[LMR](http://www.timesmicrowave.com/cms/products/cables/lmr/)-195. Once it was
adjusted, it was very easy to strip the cable for a BNC connector.
