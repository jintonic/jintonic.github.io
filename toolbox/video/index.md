# Screen cast and streaming
The Xbox app shipped with Windows 10 can record the active window as a game clip. It requires rather modern graphic cards to work. Nevertheless, it can be a handy option if you run Windows 10 in a modern PC and don't want to install any extra software.

The VLC media player can record the whole desktop with its *Convert* tool. You can bring it up by holding the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key and press <kbd>r</kbd> and choose the *Capture Device* to be *Desktop*. It should work in all OS that VLC can run.

A dedicated free screen cast and streaming program is the *Open Broadcaster Software*, known as *OBS*. It works in all major OS, has intuitive GUI to tune many settings, and won't slow your computer down.
