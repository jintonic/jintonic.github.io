According to Wikipedia:
>Grid computing is the collection of computer resources from multiple 
>locations to reach a common goal. The grid can be thought of as a distributed 
>system with non-interactive workloads that involve a large number of files. 
>Grid computing is distinguished from conventional high performance computing 
>systems such as cluster computing in that grid computers have each node set 
>to perform a different task/application.
