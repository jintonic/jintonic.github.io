[The Center for Teaching and Learning][ctl] at [USD] organized a workshop on 
promotion and tenure process. The vice president in academic affairs, Jim 
Moran, described the [USD] mission and vision as the context of the process. An 
important aspect of tenure is to protect the academic freedom as pointed out by 
him. He also gave some statistics of the historical promotion and tenure rate:

FY 09-15 | Applicants | Approved
---------|------------|---------
Associate| 76         | 67 (88.2%)
Tenure   | 81         | 74 (91.4%)
Full     | 30         | 22 (73.3%)

According to him, the rate is way above the national average, which is about 
60% if I remember correctly.

He then asked some FAQ to three panelists, [Jill Tyler][jill], [Mike 
Allgrum][mike] and [Dave Burrow][dave], who are members of the [USD] Promotion 
& Tenure Committee. Things that I learned from the discussion are summarized 
here.

- It is natural that your performance in teaching in the first year is bad. 
  Admit it, try to fix it, and don't be defensive. It is OK, as long as you 
  show a clear trajectory of improvement in late years.
- Describe in detail what is your role in each publication. Such as why there 
  are so many coauthors, why your student is the first author instead of you, 
  etc. Most people in the promotion and tenure committee are not from your 
  discipline, and don't know situation which is common in your field. Explain 
  to them instead of letting them to figure it out.
- Ask your chair to setup a context for your development. Clear define the 
  percentage of your teaching, research and service tasks. It is OK if the 
  percentage changes according to the needs of your department as long as your 
  effort reflects the changes.
- Track your effort to tenure clearly and frequently. Update the database where 
  you keep the record of your effort frequently.
- The promotion and tenure committee knows that you are human, that the 
  decision is very important to you. They assume that you are qualified, and 
  try to find the evidence from your submitted material - Make those evidence 
  clear to them so that they don't have to search hard.
- The promotion and tenure committee only check if you meet the criteria, it is 
  not about your personality or anything else.
- You can contact the Council of Higher Education (COHE) if you feel that you 
  are treated unfair in the process. Do it as soon as possible. However, COHE 
  cannot change the decision. It can only investigate whether the process 
  leading to the decision is fair or not.
- Try to do services that you are passionated about. Don't take too much 
  services that you don't have time to teach and conduct research.
