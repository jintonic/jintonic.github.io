I got an email from the human resource office telling me how to get started
with my green card application process. The first step is to get a *permanent
labor certification* issued by the *Department of Labor* (DOL). [The employer
has to submit the *Form 9089* to the DOL's *Employment and Training
Administration* (ETA)](http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/perm_detail.cfm).
I need to provide detailed information about my job and previous H-1B history
to help them fill *Form 9089*.
