I became a member of the Council for Undergraduate Research & Creative 
Scholarship, [CURCS][], at [USD][] last fall. An important responsibility of 
[CURCS][] is to provide [mini-grants][mini] to encourage undergraduate students 
to conduct research or creative activities. We had the first [CURCS][] monthly 
meeting of the spring semester this morning. It was reported that the number of 
applications to the [mini-grants][mini] was dropped recently for various 
reasons. [Sarah Wittmuss][sarah], the director of the [Center for Academic & 
Global Engagement][cage] made a motion to return to rolling applications, 
meaning that, we will process applications immediately after they are turned in 
and there is no deadline till the end of this semester. This will significantly 
shorten the interval between the turning-in of an application and the issuing 
of the grant and will enlarge the time window within which the submission of 
application is allowed. The motion was supported by all the members and will be 
carried on immediately. I encouraged all my undergraduate students to take this 
chance. No matter what would be the result, they will gain experience on 
funding application which is not so common among undergraduates.
