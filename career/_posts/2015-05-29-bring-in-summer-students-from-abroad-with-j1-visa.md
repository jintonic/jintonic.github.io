Three undergraduate students from the [Department of Engineering Physics][dep] 
of the [Tsinghua University][ts], Beijing, China, contacted me, asking for 
opportunity to do summer interns in [our department][usdphys]. They were 
recommended by [our university][usd] to come with J-1 visa. After going through 
the whole process, I figured out a check list that a foreign student needs to 
provide to the host institute to initiate the process. Hope it can help foreign 
students who want to come in the future.

1. a copy of your passport information page and any previous US visa 
information
2.  evidence that you've purchased [insurance required by J-1][inj] (receipt 
for example)
3. evidence of financial support. If you cannot get enough support from your 
own and the host institutes, you should consider providing your parents' bank 
statement and a certificate showing your relationship with your parents
4. a copy of the invitation letter from your host institute signed by you, 
where the participation dates and your duty and responsibility should be stated 
clearly
5. detailed mailing address (used by the host institute to send the DS-2019 
form to you by fed-ex)
6. CV

Once all information is collected, the host institute would be able to create 
the DS-2019 form, where you can get the SEVIS ID and Program Number. You can 
then use the SEVIS ID and Program Number to [schedule visa interview 
online][sch].
