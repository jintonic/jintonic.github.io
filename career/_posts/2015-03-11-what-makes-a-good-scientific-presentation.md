Most good physicists are actually good at presenting their scientific works,
otherwise they would not have survived in the field. I required my students in
PHYS-332, Experimental Modern Physics, to give a 10-minute presentation on one
of the experiments they did as their middle term examination as I believed that
this was a quite useful training for their career development. I also asked the
students to comment on each other's presentation, knowing that it was much
easier for them to accept their peers' opinions other than those from an
instructor.  They were asked to write down what they liked most and hated most
in a presentation anonymously. I gathered and read all the comments right after
each presentation. What I found interesting was that the good and bad aspects
of a presentation were usually pointed out repeatedly from different people. It
became quite clear what needed to be improved after all comments were read.

According to their comments, the students believed that the practices listed at
the beginning would help make a good scientific presentation.  I was glad that
they figured out essential things by themselves and had a good sense of humor.
