Three undergraduate students from the [Department of Engineering Physics][dep] 
of the [Tsinghua University][ts], Beijing, China, arrived at [USD][] last week 
and will spend one and half month here as summer interns. They came here with 
J-1 visas. Normally, when they go back from here, they will have to stay in 
China for two years before they can apply again for J-1 visas to study in 
graduate schools in US. However they just finished the third year study in 
their university and want to come to US as graduate students next year. In 
order to allow them to do so, [USD][] helped them obtain the [waiver of the 
exchange visitor two-year home-country physical presence requirement][wv]. This 
way, they can come to gain research experience at [USD][] without worrying any 
delay in their applications to US graduate schools a year later.
