Buy a car
=========

It is amazing that cars older than 10 years with mileages above 100k are
commonly seen everywhere. Japanese tend to get rid of this kind of cars. This
is probably due to the following facts:

- Major cities are all connected by super express trains in Japan. Cars are
  mainly used in urban area with a lot of starts and stops.
- There is almost no train connection between cities in US at all. Cars are
  used for inter city or inter state travels a lot.

It is easier to buy a car in US than in Japan. One don't need to find a parking
lot first.

One does not need to have a driver's license to buy a car, as long as he can
find someone else who can drive the car back home legally.

Driving test
============

Check [http://driverslicensetest.net](http://driverslicensetest.net) first
before taking a written test. It is more helpful than merely reading the
*Driver License Manual*.
