![south dakota employee health plan plot with premium](/usa/insurance/south-dakota-employee-health-plan+premium.jpg)

Out of an experimentalist's habit, I compared with graphs the three health plans
provided to employees by the state of South Dakota. The assumed scenario is a
middle age (30~39) couple with 2 or more children, one of the family member
needs most of the medical care, and the premium is paid in 12 pay periods. I
wanted to find out how much they have to pay by themselves annually (y-axis)
given different total medical care cost (x-axis). The result came as a surprise
to me and most of my colleagues:

**The $750 deductible health plan, sold as the best option, is actually the
most expensive one; while the $1,800 deductible plan, which only kicks in after
the family pays more than $3,600, is surprisingly the cheapest one. And this
result holds true no matter how much medical bill one has to pay.**

Think twice, and this is easy to understand. One needs to pay more premium to
be entitled for the plan with the smallest deductible. Without taking into
account the premium, the $750 deductible plan is in no double the best choice,
as shown in the bottom plot. If you add up the annual premium to each plan,
respectively, the $1,800 deductible plan becomes the cheapest, as shown in the
top plot. Note that, if the state does not contributes $300 to the $1,800 plan,
the $1,250 plan would be $300 cheaper in the region around $4,000 to $6,000.
With this $300 deducted, the highest deductible plan becomes the cheapest in
all region.

I did not analyze other scenarios, but it is fairly easy to generate similar
plots for other scenarios using a spreadsheet program. The important message
here is that **plots help you understand data, in physics or in daily life.**
