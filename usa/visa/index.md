One needs to apply for the temporary worker visa, [H-1B][h1b], to work in
some specialty occupation in US. The first thing is to provide his employer
enough supporting documents so that the latter can apply for the Notice of
Action, form I-797 to USCIS. Once he gets the form I-797, he can fill the
[DS-160][ds160] non-immigrant visa application form online.  It is needed
before scheduling a visa interview.

Family members need to apply for [H-4][h4] visa.  The whole family has to fill
the [DS-160][ds160] non-immigrant visa application form online including kids.
It is needed before scheduling a visa interview.

There is a [dedicated web site][ustd] to apply for US visa in Japan, where one
can fill in the DS-160 and I-797 information, pay the application fee and
schedule the interview.
