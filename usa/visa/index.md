One needs to apply for the temporary worker visa, [H-1B][h1b], to work in some
specialty occupation in US. Before the application, a petition for
"Nonimmigrant Worker", form I-129, must be filed on his behalf by his
prospective employer and be approved by USCIS.  Once the petition is approved,
USCIS will send the employer a "Notice of Action", form I-797.  The applicant
needs the "receipt number" to fill the [DS-160][ds160] non-immigrant visa
application form online.  He needs the DS-160 confirmation number, the start
and expiration dates of the petition and the receipt number to schedule a visa
interview.

Family members need to apply for [H-4][h4] visa.  The whole family has to fill
the [DS-160][ds160] non-immigrant visa application form online including kids.
They need exactly the same things as the H-1B applicant to schedule a visa
interview.

There is a [dedicated web site][ustd] to apply for US visa in Japan, where one
can fill in the DS-160 and I-797 information, pay the application fee and
schedule the interview.
