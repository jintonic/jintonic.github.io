The physics chair asked me today if I would like to apply for the green card. I
said yes, I just have not found time to do it yet. She told me that the
university could only help me within 18 months after my hiring. This came as a
surprise to me. Anyway, the human resource office will initiate the process and
I will have to work on it.
