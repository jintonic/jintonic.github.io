Buy a car from another person
=============================

Most Japanese buy second-handed cars from dealers, who charges a lot for the
paper work. If you do all the paper work by yourself, it is more than 10 times
cheaper. My dealer did not allow me to do it by myself.

If your friends would like to sell his car to you, you can then do everything
by yourself. If you have money but no time, hire a dealer and ask them to do
the paper work. But why not just buy a new car then.

Things you need to do except for paying the money:

1. get a name stamp
  * stamps are used as signs in Japan
  * many official documents need to be stamped instead of being signed
  * go to a stamp shop ask for the cheapest one (about 2000 yen)
  * make sure the name on the stamp is the same as the one in your resident card
  * register it in the city hall
  * get a stamp certificate from the city hall (not older than 3 months)
2. get certificate for your parking lot
  * rent a parking lot from a real estate agent
  * ask them for maps showing the location of your parking lot
  * bring maps and your stamp certificate to the police office
  * get certificate for your parking lot from them
3. change owner of the car
